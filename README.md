**Flickr Image Search - iOS App**

- Using this app you can search for photos available on Flickr.
- Please see this [video](https://github.com/DeveshBisen/flickr-image-search/blob/main/Demo_FlickrImageSearch.mov) for app demo.

Note
- As this app uses public API keys, it's usually gets expired maybe in less then 12 hours.
- So, we need to use latest key for accessing Flickr API, otherwise network request will fail.
